# Ensemble-Resnet-18-with-ProxyNCALoss
This contains implementation of Ensemble Resnet18 for embeddings as provided in Deep Randomized Ensembles for Metric
Learning paper. This is an implementation of all the methods mentioned in the paper. I have also implemented my own Proxy NCA Loss for this. System was trained on Cifar 10 dataset for only 50 iterations. Feel free to reuse the code to train on your own dataset. Loss function is tested and is working find. You may find the test code in comments.
